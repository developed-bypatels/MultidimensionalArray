# MultidimensionalArray
Developed a program that will analyze a set of elevation data collected in a text file. The text file is formatted as a series of rows and columns. The first row will contain two values that are the number of rows of data followed by the number of columns. All of the values in the data file are integer values in the range of 0 to 9500 inclusive. This is an absolute range and it is known that the data will reside within this range. However, the range of data could be smaller than the absolute range.
